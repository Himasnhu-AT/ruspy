# Compiler Design for Ruspy

## Introduction

The Ruspy project is an experimental language that combines the efficiency of Rust with the simplicity and readability of Python. This document outlines the design principles and architecture of the Ruspy compiler.

## Design Goals

- **Performance**: Achieve Rust-like performance by leveraging its powerful features.
- **Simplicity**: Maintain a Python-like syntax to ensure ease of learning and use.
- **Educational**: Serve as a learning tool for understanding compiler design and implementation.

## Architecture Overview

The Ruspy compiler is structured into several key components:

1. **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizes the input source code into a stream of tokens.
2. **Syntax Analysis**: Parses the token stream to generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
3. **Semantic Analysis**: Checks the AST for semantic errors and ensures type safety.
4. **Intermediate Code Generation**: Transforms the AST into an intermediate representation.
5. **Optimization**: Applies various optimization techniques to improve performance.
6. **Code Generation**: Converts the optimized intermediate code into target machine code.

## Key Concepts

- **Ownership and Borrowing**: Inspired by Rust, Ruspy incorporates ownership and borrowing concepts to manage memory safely.
- **Type Inference**: Ruspy supports type inference to reduce the verbosity of code while maintaining type safety.
- **Pattern Matching**: Provides powerful pattern matching capabilities similar to Rust.

## Challenges

- **Balancing Performance and Simplicity**: Ensuring high performance while keeping the syntax simple and intuitive.
- **Memory Safety**: Implementing Rust's memory safety features without a garbage collector.

## Future Work

- **Advanced Optimizations**: Explore more sophisticated optimization techniques.
- **Tooling and IDE Support**: Develop tools and IDE plugins to enhance the developer experience.
- **Community Feedback**: Gather feedback from the community to guide future development.
